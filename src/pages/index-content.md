title: Midnight Train
---
Midnight Train play a blend of classic up tempo blues with a mix of sometimes
surprising songs infused with their unique style and sound to create a fun and
infectious set-list.

With roots going back to the original Midnight Train of the late '60's the current line up pay homage to the musical genre that gave birth to rock and roll and influenced all popular music that followed.

By adding a contemporary twist to classics both old and new, the band keeps the music fresh and relevant.

The five piece line up has Mike Storey on drums, one of the founding members of the original band, his style influenced by his early jazz and soul involvement, Ken Baker on bass adding that all important drive to the rhythm section, on the front line Stewart Speirs an experienced harmonica player always giving an energetic performance, the talented Andy Lovekin on lead guitar providing the riffs and spine tingling solos and with John Watsonâ€™s strong, soulful and bluesy voice delivering powerful Blues vocals.
